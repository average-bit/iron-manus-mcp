# Manus FSM Orchestrator - Live Demo Session Log

**Session Overview**: Creating an interactive HTML architecture walkthrough using the Manus MCP FSM Orchestrator

**Demonstration of**: 6-step agent loop, fractal orchestration, cognitive enhancement, and Claude Code CLI integration

---

## üéØ Session Initialization

```
‚è∫ Use orchestrate tool to make a visually engaging html file that walks me through your architecture , claude code cli WITH my manus mcp
```

**Internal Working**: User initiates orchestration request. The Manus FSM immediately:
- Detects the task complexity (multi-step creative + technical work)
- Initializes session `arch_walkthrough_001`
- Begins 6-step agent loop

---

## üîÑ Phase 1: QUERY (Analyze Events)

```
‚è∫ manus-fsm-orchestrator:manus_orchestrator (MCP)(session_id: "arch_walkthrough_001", initial_objective: "Create a visually engaging HTML file...")
```

**What's Happening Internally**:
- **Role Detection**: FSM analyzes the request and detects it needs a "synthesizer" role (combining visual design + technical documentation)
- **Cognitive Enhancement**: Applies 2.9x reasoning effectiveness multiplier for synthesizer role
- **Goal Interpretation**: Breaks down the complex request into core requirements:
  - Interactive diagrams ‚úì
  - FSM loop visualization ‚úì 
  - Claude Code CLI integration ‚úì
  - Educational presentation ‚úì

**Key Insight**: The FSM doesn't just execute - it *analyzes* the user's intent and enhances its reasoning capacity based on role detection.

---

## üîÑ Phase 2: ENHANCE (Select Tools)

```
‚è∫ enhanced_goal: "Create a comprehensive, interactive HTML documentation file..."
```

**Internal Architecture at Work**:
- **Goal Refinement**: Takes the interpreted goal and adds missing technical details
- **Resource Planning**: Identifies what tools and knowledge will be needed
- **Constraint Analysis**: Determines technical requirements (single HTML file, accessibility, etc.)
- **Edge Case Identification**: Anticipates potential challenges

**Enhancement Multiplier Effect**: The 2.9x cognitive enhancement is visible here - the enhanced goal is significantly more detailed and technically precise than the original request.

---

## üîÑ Phase 3: KNOWLEDGE (Module)

```
‚è∫ Read(src/fsm.ts)
‚è∫ Read(src/prompts.ts)
```

**Knowledge Module in Action**:
- **Self-Analysis**: The FSM reads its own source code to understand its architecture
- **Documentation Mining**: Extracts technical details about the 6-step loop, cognitive multipliers, etc.
- **Integration Mapping**: Understands how it integrates with Claude Code CLI tools

**Fractal Intelligence**: The system is analyzing itself to document itself - demonstrating recursive self-awareness.

---

## üîÑ Phase 4: PLAN (Module)

```
‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òê Use Manus orchestrator to analyze the architecture and create HTML walkthrough
     ‚òê (ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: html_visualization) (PROMPT: Create HTML structure...)
     ‚òê (ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: css_styling) (PROMPT: Implement modern CSS...)
     ‚òê (ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: javascript_interactivity) (PROMPT: Build interactive FSM...)
```

**Hierarchical Task Decomposition**:
- **Level 1 Planning**: Main FSM creates high-level todos
- **Meta-Prompt Embedding**: Complex tasks get special meta-prompt format for Task() agent spawning
- **Role Specialization**: Different subtasks assigned specific roles (coder for implementation)
- **Priority Management**: Critical vs. optional tasks prioritized

**Architecture Highlight**: Notice the meta-prompt structure: `(ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: html_visualization) (PROMPT: ...) (OUTPUT: ...)` - this is how the FSM prepares to spawn specialized sub-agents.

---

## üîÑ Phase 5: EXECUTE (Datasource Module)

```
‚è∫ Task(Create HTML foundation)
  ‚éø  Done (4 tool uses ¬∑ 23.1k tokens ¬∑ 4m 1.6s)

‚è∫ Task(Create CSS styling)  
  ‚éø  Done (17 tool uses ¬∑ 76.5k tokens ¬∑ 7m 28.3s)

‚è∫ Task(Create JavaScript interactivity)
  ‚éø  Done (32 tool uses ¬∑ 66.6k tokens ¬∑ 8m 50.4s)
```

**Fractal Orchestration in Action**:
- **Task() Agent Spawning**: Main FSM spawns 3 specialized Task() agents
- **Independent Execution**: Each Task() agent operates autonomously with its own tools and reasoning
- **Resource Tracking**: Token usage and time tracking for each sub-agent
- **Progressive Building**: HTML ‚Üí CSS ‚Üí JavaScript in logical sequence

**Single-Tool-Per-Iteration**: Notice each Task() agent follows the same principle - one tool call per iteration, maintaining deterministic control.

---

## üîÑ Phase 6: VERIFY (Quality Assessment)

```
‚è∫ verification_passed: true
‚è∫ quality_metrics: {"functional_completeness":100,"visual_engagement":95,"technical_implementation":98}
```

**Verification System**:
- **Strict Completion Validation**: Checks all critical tasks completed (100% threshold)
- **Quality Metrics**: Multi-dimensional assessment of deliverable quality
- **Objective Fulfillment**: Validates original goals were met and exceeded

**Critical Architecture Feature**: The verification system prevents premature completion - it enforces quality standards before marking work as done.

---

## üéØ Final Deliverable

**File Created**: `manus-architecture-walkthrough.html`
- **Interactive FSM Diagram**: Clickable 6-step agent loop
- **Cognitive Enhancement Demo**: Live 2.3x-3.2x multiplier visualization  
- **Claude Code CLI Integration**: Comprehensive tool examples
- **Modern UI**: Dark/light themes, animations, accessibility
