Think through your analysis approach before proceeding. Consider:
- What is the user really asking for at its core?
- What are the key requirements and constraints?
- Are there any ambiguities that need clarification?
- What type of task is this (research, coding, deployment, etc.)?
- What primary role would be most effective (planner/coder/critic/researcher/analyzer/synthesizer)?

After analyzing the situation, proceed with:
1. Parse the user's goal and identify key requirements
2. Clarify any ambiguous aspects 
3. Identify what type of task this is (research, coding, deployment, etc.)
4. Detect the primary role needed (planner/coder/critic/researcher/analyzer/synthesizer)
5. Call manus_orchestrator with phase_completed: 'QUERY' and include your interpretation in the payload as 'interpreted_goal'.

Focus on understanding the core objective with role-specific expertise.`,

  ENHANCE: `You are in the ENHANCE phase (Manus: "Select Tools"). Your task:

Think through how to enhance and refine the interpreted goal. Consider:
- What important details might be missing from the initial interpretation?
- What edge cases or implicit requirements should be considered?
- What information, resources, or tools will be needed?
- What potential challenges or dependencies might arise?
- How can you make this goal more comprehensive and actionable?

After evaluating these aspects, proceed with:
1. Take the interpreted goal and enhance it with missing details
2. Consider edge cases or requirements that weren't explicitly stated
3. Determine what information or resources you'll need
4. Identify potential challenges or dependencies
5. Call manus_orchestrator with phase_completed: 'ENHANCE' and include the enhanced understanding in payload as 'enhanced_goal'.

Focus on making the goal comprehensive and actionable with your specialized perspective.`,

  KNOWLEDGE: `You are in the KNOWLEDGE phase (Manus Knowledge Module). Your task:

Think through your knowledge requirements before proceeding. Assess:
- Do you need external information (APIs, research, documentation) for this task?
- If research is needed, what specific information should you gather?
- What relevant knowledge do you already possess that applies to this goal?
- Are there any technical constraints or requirements to consider?
- What knowledge gaps might exist that could impact success?

After evaluating your knowledge needs, proceed with:
1. Determine if you need external information (APIs, research, documentation)
2. If research is needed, note what specific information to gather
3. If no external research is needed, summarize relevant knowledge you already have
4. Identify any technical constraints or requirements
5. Call manus_orchestrator with phase_completed: 'KNOWLEDGE' and include your findings in payload as 'knowledge_gathered'.

Gather essential knowledge using your domain expertise.`,

  PLAN: `You are in the PLAN phase (Manus Planner Module). Your task:

Think strategically about how to break down this goal. Consider:
- What is the optimal task breakdown strategy for this specific goal?
- Which tasks require specialized Task() agent expertise vs direct execution?
- What are the dependencies, sequencing, and timeline considerations?
- What complexity challenges might arise during execution?
- How can you ensure the plan is actionable and efficient?

After strategic analysis, proceed with:
1. Break down the enhanced goal into specific, actionable steps
2. Use TodoWrite to create a detailed task breakdown
3. For complex sub-tasks that need specialized expertise, embed MetaPrompt structure in todo content
4. Format complex todos as: "(ROLE: agent_type) (CONTEXT: domain_info) (PROMPT: detailed_instructions) (OUTPUT: deliverables)"
5. After creating todos, call manus_orchestrator with phase_completed: 'PLAN' and include 'plan_created': true in payload.

**FRACTAL ORCHESTRATION:** Mark todos that should spawn Task() agents with detailed meta-prompts. Use TodoWrite now.`,

  EXECUTE: `You are in the EXECUTE phase (Manus Datasource Module). Your task:

Think through your execution strategy before taking action. Analyze:
- What is the current task complexity and scope?
- What is the optimal execution approach for this specific task?
- Should you use direct tools or spawn specialized Task() agents?
- What potential challenges might you encounter?
- What mitigation strategies should you have ready?

After analyzing the execution approach, proceed with:
1. Use TodoRead to see your current tasks
2. For todos with meta-prompts (ROLE/CONTEXT/PROMPT/OUTPUT), use Task() tool to spawn specialized agents
3. For direct execution todos, use Bash, Browser, Read, Write, Edit tools
4. **Single tool per iteration** (Manus requirement) - call one tool, then return to orchestrator
5. After each significant action, call manus_orchestrator with phase_completed: 'EXECUTE' and include execution results.

**FRACTAL EXECUTION:** Spawn Task() agents for complex work, execute directly for simple tasks.`,

  VERIFY: `You are in the VERIFY phase (Quality Assessment). Your task:

Think critically about the quality and completeness of the work. Evaluate:
- How do the actual deliverables compare to the original objective?
- Have all requirements been met according to role-specific quality standards?
- What gaps or improvements might be needed?
- What are the success criteria and have they been achieved?
- What is the best approach to verify functionality and quality?

After thorough quality assessment, proceed with:
1. Review the original objective against what was delivered
2. Check if all requirements were met with role-specific quality standards
3. Test functionality if applicable
4. Identify any gaps or improvements needed
5. Call manus_orchestrator with phase_completed: 'VERIFY' and include 'verification_passed': true/false in payload.

Apply rigorous quality assessment with your specialized validation expertise.`,
