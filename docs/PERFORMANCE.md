# Performance Optimization Guide

This guide covers context optimization, scaling strategies, and performance best practices for Iron Manus MCP.

## Overview

Iron Manus MCP is designed to handle complex projects through Thread-of-Thought context segmentation. However, understanding performance characteristics and optimization strategies helps maximize effectiveness and avoid common bottlenecks.

## Context Window Optimization

### Understanding Context Segmentation

**The Problem**: Claude has limited context window size, which typically breaks down on complex projects.

**The Solution**: Iron Manus uses FSM phase segmentation to manage context efficiently:

```text
Traditional Approach:
[Massive Context] ‚Üí Limited effectiveness

Iron Manus Approach:
[QUERY Context] ‚Üí [ENHANCE Context] ‚Üí [KNOWLEDGE Context] 
    ‚Üì                 ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
[PLAN Context] ‚Üí [EXECUTE Context] ‚Üí [VERIFY Context]
```

### Context Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Objective Complexity Management

**Optimal Objective Size:**
```text
‚úÖ Good: "Create a React login component with JWT authentication"
‚úÖ Good: "Build a Node.js API with user CRUD operations"
‚ö†Ô∏è Large: "Create a full-stack e-commerce platform with React frontend, Node.js backend, authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, payment integration, admin dashboard, and deployment"
‚ùå Too Large: "Build a complete SaaS application with multiple microservices, React frontend, multiple databases, authentication, payment processing, analytics, monitoring, CI/CD, and cloud deployment"
```

**Complexity Indicators:**
- **Simple**: 1-3 major components, single technology stack
- **Medium**: 4-8 components, mixed technologies, moderate integration
- **Complex**: 8+ components, multiple systems, extensive integration
- **Too Complex**: Enterprise-scale with multiple services and platforms

#### 2. Hierarchical Task Breakdown

**Effective Strategies:**

**Sequential Development:**
```text
Session 1: Authentication system (login, signup, JWT handling)
Session 2: User management (CRUD, profiles, permissions)
Session 3: Dashboard implementation (UI, data display, interactions)
Session 4: Integration and testing (API connections, error handling)
```

**Feature-Based Segmentation:**
```text
Session A: Core architecture and setup
Session B: Backend API and database
Session C: Frontend components and state management
Session D: Integration, testing, and deployment
```

#### 3. Agent Spawning Optimization

**Optimal Agent Usage:**

**Concurrent Agents (Recommended):**
```text
‚úÖ 2-3 specialized agents working in parallel
‚úÖ Clear domain separation (UI vs Backend vs Integration)
‚úÖ Specific, focused meta-prompts
```

**Avoid Agent Overload:**
```text
‚ùå 5+ concurrent agents (context dilution)
‚ùå Overlapping agent responsibilities
‚ùå Generic agents without clear specialization
```

**Agent Specialization Patterns:**
```typescript
// Effective agent delegation
(ROLE: ui_implementer) (CONTEXT: react_components) (PROMPT: Create login/signup forms) (OUTPUT: react_components)
(ROLE: coder) (CONTEXT: api_services) (PROMPT: Build authentication service) (OUTPUT: service_code)

// Less effective
(ROLE: planner) (CONTEXT: everything) (PROMPT: Handle all development) (OUTPUT: complete_system)
```

## Scaling Strategies

### Project Size Management

#### Small Projects (1-10 files)
- **Single session approach**
- **Direct implementation**
- **Minimal agent spawning**

```text
Objective: "Create a todo list React component with add/remove functionality"
Expected: 3-4 phases, single session, 5-10 minutes
```

#### Medium Projects (10-50 files)
- **Component-based sessions**
- **Strategic agent delegation**
- **Progressive feature development**

```text
Session 1: "Core todo list functionality with local state"
Session 2: "Add persistence with localStorage and data validation"
Session 3: "Implement filtering, sorting, and advanced features"
```

#### Large Projects (50+ files)
- **Architecture-first approach**
- **Multiple specialized sessions**
- **Systematic integration planning**

```text
Session 1: "Design overall architecture and component hierarchy"
Session 2: "Implement core data layer and API structure"
Session 3: "Build main UI components and state management"
Session 4: "Create specialized features and integrations"
Session 5: "Testing, optimization, and deployment setup"
```

### Performance Benchmarks

#### FSM Phase Performance

**Typical Phase Durations:**
- **QUERY**: 30-60 seconds (analysis and role detection)
- **ENHANCE**: 45-90 seconds (requirement expansion)
- **KNOWLEDGE**: 60-180 seconds (API research, variable based on complexity)
- **PLAN**: 90-150 seconds (task decomposition and meta-prompt generation)
- **EXECUTE**: 180-600 seconds (agent spawning and parallel execution)
- **VERIFY**: 60-120 seconds (validation and completion checks)

**Total Session Time:**
- **Simple projects**: 8-15 minutes
- **Medium projects**: 15-30 minutes per session
- **Complex projects**: 25-45 minutes per session

#### Agent Spawning Performance

**Agent Response Times:**
- **UI components**: 2-5 minutes per component
- **API services**: 3-8 minutes per service
- **Integration tasks**: 5-15 minutes depending on complexity
- **Research tasks**: 3-10 minutes depending on scope

## Memory and Resource Optimization

### Context Memory Management

**Memory-Efficient Patterns:**

```text
‚úÖ Progressive Information Building:
Phase 1: High-level requirements ‚Üí Phase 2: Technical specs ‚Üí Phase 3: Implementation

‚úÖ Agent Context Isolation:
Each Task() agent gets focused context for their specific domain

‚úÖ Session State Cleanup:
Completed phases release context, maintaining only essential state
```

**Memory-Intensive Anti-Patterns:**
```text
‚ùå Carrying full project context through all phases
‚ùå Spawning agents with overlapping, redundant context
‚ùå Accumulating unused research data across sessions
```

### Resource Usage Optimization

#### Network Optimization

**API Usage Patterns:**
```text
‚úÖ Batched API requests in KNOWLEDGE phase
‚úÖ Parallel API fetching with MultiAPIFetch tool
‚úÖ Strategic caching of research results

‚ùå Repeated API calls for same information
‚ùå Sequential API requests when parallel is possible
‚ùå Fetching unused API data
```

#### Computation Optimization

**Efficient Processing:**
- **Use appropriate FSM phases** for task types
- **Leverage parallel agent execution** for independent tasks
- **Minimize context switching** between unrelated activities
