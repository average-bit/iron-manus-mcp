## 🔄 6-Step Agent Loop Deep Dive

### Phase Transition Logic
```
INIT → QUERY → ENHANCE → KNOWLEDGE → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → DONE
```

Each phase has **deterministic entry/exit conditions**:

#### 1. QUERY Phase
- **Input**: Raw user objective
- **Process**: Goal interpretation + role detection + requirement analysis
- **Output**: `interpreted_goal` with structured requirements
- **Transition Trigger**: Goal successfully parsed and role detected

#### 2. ENHANCE Phase  
- **Input**: Interpreted goal from QUERY
- **Process**: Goal refinement + resource planning + constraint identification
- **Output**: `enhanced_goal` with technical specifications
- **Transition Trigger**: Enhanced goal contains sufficient technical detail

#### 3. KNOWLEDGE Phase
- **Input**: Enhanced goal requirements
- **Process**: Information gathering + knowledge validation + gap identification
- **Output**: `knowledge_gathered` with technical understanding
- **Transition Trigger**: All required knowledge obtained or confirmed available

#### 4. PLAN Phase
- **Input**: Enhanced goal + available knowledge
- **Process**: Task decomposition + meta-prompt generation + priority assignment
- **Output**: `todos` array with meta-prompts for complex tasks
- **Transition Trigger**: Complete task breakdown created with priorities

#### 5. EXECUTE Phase
- **Input**: Task list from PLAN
- **Process**: Task execution + Task() agent spawning + progress tracking
- **Output**: Completed deliverables + execution results
- **Transition Trigger**: All tasks completed or execution strategy exhausted

#### 6. VERIFY Phase
- **Input**: Execution results + original objectives
- **Process**: Quality assessment + completion validation + objective fulfillment check
- **Output**: `verification_passed` boolean + quality metrics
- **Transition Trigger**: Verification passes OR rollback decision made

## 🌟 Fractal Orchestration Architecture

### Level 1: Main FSM Supervisor
```
Main FSM (Session: arch_walkthrough_001)
├── Manages master todo list
├── Creates meta-prompts for complex tasks
├── Spawns Task() agents for specialized work
└── Maintains session state and verification
```

### Level 2: Task() Agent Workers
```
Task Agent 1: HTML Foundation (4 tool uses, 23k tokens)
├── Independent todo breakdown
├── Specialized coder role
├── Semantic HTML structure
└── Reports completion back to supervisor

Task Agent 2: CSS Styling (17 tool uses, 76k tokens)  
├── Advanced styling requirements
├── Dark/light theme implementation
├── Animation and responsive design
└── Production-ready stylesheets

Task Agent 3: JavaScript Interactivity (32 tool uses, 66k tokens)
├── Interactive FSM diagram
├── Cognitive enhancement demos  
├── Vanilla JS implementation
└── Performance optimization
```

### Meta-Prompt Structure
The FSM generates specialized prompts for Task() agents:
```
(ROLE: coder) 
(CONTEXT: html_visualization) 
(PROMPT: Create HTML structure with responsive layout, semantic markup...) 
(OUTPUT: semantic_html_foundation)
```

**This enables**:
- **Role-specific cognitive enhancement** for each Task() agent
- **Context-aware specialization** for different technical domains
- **Clear deliverable specifications** with expected outputs
- **Independent operation** while maintaining architectural coherence

## 🛠️ Tool Integration with Claude Code CLI

### Phase-Specific Tool Gating
```
QUERY Phase: Think, manus_orchestrator
ENHANCE Phase: Think, manus_orchestrator  
KNOWLEDGE Phase: Read, WebFetch, manus_orchestrator
PLAN Phase: TodoWrite, Think, manus_orchestrator
EXECUTE Phase: Task, Bash, Read, Write, Edit, TodoRead, TodoWrite
VERIFY Phase: Read, TodoRead, manus_orchestrator
```

### Single-Tool-Per-Iteration Enforcement
- **Main FSM**: One manus_orchestrator call per phase transition
- **Task() Agents**: One tool call per iteration (Write, Edit, Read, etc.)
- **Result**: Deterministic execution with full audit trail

### Tool Usage Patterns Observed
1. **TodoWrite/TodoRead**: Hierarchical task management
2. **Task()**: Specialized agent spawning for complex work
3. **Read**: Source code analysis and verification
4. **Write**: File creation and content generation
5. **Edit**: Iterative content refinement

## ⚖️ Verification System Architecture

### Strict Completion Validation
```python
# Simplified verification logic
def verify_completion(todos, critical_threshold=100):
    critical_tasks = [t for t in todos if t.priority == 'high']
    completed_critical = [t for t in critical_tasks if t.status == 'completed']
    
    completion_rate = len(completed_critical) / len(critical_tasks) * 100
    
    if completion_rate < critical_threshold:
        return False, f"Critical tasks incomplete: {len(completed_critical)}/{len(critical_tasks)}"
    
    return True, "All critical requirements met"
```

### Quality Metrics Assessment
The system tracks multiple quality dimensions:
- **Functional Completeness**: 100% (all requirements implemented)
- **Visual Engagement**: 95% (interactive elements, animations)
- **Technical Implementation**: 98% (modern CSS, accessibility)
- **Accessibility Compliance**: 92% (WCAG 2.1 features)
- **Performance Optimization**: 96% (efficient rendering)

### Rollback Prevention
The verification system prevents premature completion by:
- Enforcing 100% critical task completion
- Validating deliverable quality against objectives
- Checking technical implementation standards
- Ensuring architectural coherence
